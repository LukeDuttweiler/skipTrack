## This is a Resubmission

### I apologize for the confusion, messed up link syntax on the last resubmission.

The previous submission gave "Found the following Rd file(s) with Rd \link{} targets missing package

anchors:
  skipTrack.diagnostics.Rd: genDiagnostic
  
Please provide package anchors for all Rd \link{} targets not in the
package itself and the base packages."

The links have been fixed.
